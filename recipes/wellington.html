    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gordon Ramsay's version of the classic steak dish – a showstopping centrepiece on a special occasion</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>a good beef fillet (preferably Aberdeen Angus) of around 1kg/2lb 4oz</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>250g/9oz chestnut mushroom, include some wild ones if you like</li>
        <li>50g/2oz butter</li>
        <li>1 large sprig fresh thyme</li>
        <li>100ml/3.5 fl oz dry white wine</li>
        <li>12 slices prosciutto</li>
        <li>500g/1lb 2oz pack puff pastry, thawed if frozen</li>
        <li>a little flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks beaten with 1 tsp water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.</li>
        <li>Sit the <strong>1kg beef fillet</strong> on a roasting tray, brush with <strong>1 tbsp olive oil</strong> and season with pepper, 
            then roast for 15 mins for medium-rare or 20 mins for medium. When the beef is cooked to your liking, 
            remove from the oven to cool, then chill in the fridge for about 20 mins.</li>
        <li>While the beef is cooling, chop <strong>250g chestnut (and wild, if you like) mushrooms</strong> as finely as possible so they have the texture of 
            coarse breadcrumbs. You can use a food processor to do this, but make sure you pulse-chop the mushrooms so they don’t become a slurry.</li>
        <li>Heat <strong>2 tbsp of the olive oil</strong> and <strong>50g butter</strong> in a large pan and fry the mushrooms on a medium heat, with <strong>1 large 
            sprig fresh thyme</strong>, for about 10 mins stirring often, until you have a softened mixture.</li>
        <li>Season the mushroom mixture, pour over <strong>100ml dry white wine</strong> and cook for about 10 mins until all the wine has been absorbed. 
            The mixture should hold its shape when stirred.</li>
        <li>Remove the mushroom duxelle from the pan to cool and discard the thyme.</li>
        <li>Overlap two pieces of cling film over a large chopping board. Lay <strong>12 slices prosciutto</strong> on the cling film, slightly overlapping, in a double row.</li>
        <li>Spread half the duxelles over the prosciutto, then sit the fillet on it and spread the remaining duxelles over.</li>
        <li>Use the cling film’s edges to draw the prosciutto around the fillet, then roll it into a sausage shape, twisting the ends of cling film to tighten it as you go.</li>
        <li>Chill the fillet while you roll out the pastry.</li>
        <li>Dust your work surface with a <strong>little flour</strong>. Roll out <strong>a third of the 500g pack of puff pastry</strong> to a 18 x 30cm strip and place on a non-stick baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Roll out the <strong>remainder of the 500g pack of puff pastry</strong> to about 28 x 36cm.</li>
        <li>Unravel the fillet from the cling film and sit it in the centre of the smaller strip of pastry.</li>
        <li>Beat the <strong>2 egg yolks with 1 tsp water</strong> and brush the pastry’s edges, and the top and sides of the wrapped fillet.</li>
        <li>Using a rolling pin, carefully lift and drape the larger piece of pastry over the fillet, pressing well into the sides.</li>
        <li>Trim the joins to about a 4cm rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or spoon handle.</li>
        <li>Glaze all over with more egg yolk and, using the back of a knife, mark the beef Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry.</li>
        <li>Chill for at least 30 mins and up to 24 hrs. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.</li>
        <li>Brush the Wellington with a little more egg yolk and cook until golden and crisp – 20-25 mins for medium-rare beef, 30 mins for medium. Allow to stand for 10 mins before serving in thick slices.</li>
